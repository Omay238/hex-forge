# hex forge
###### a low effort framework for hexagon grids in games with bevy

## about
made for hack club siege week 8. i really struggled with the theme this week, so what i made is... quite mediocre. in
fact, i'd even call it bad. anyways, i think it's enough.

## tech stack
just runs on rust. uses the bevy engine for the stuff that it does lol. this is my first time using bevy, so that's
cool.
